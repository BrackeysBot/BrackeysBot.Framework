## About
BrackeysBot is a C# Discord bot targeting .NET 6 with the goal of segregating functionality through the use of hot-swappable plugins.

The aim of this project is to better organise the featureset of the ever-growing [BrackeysBot](https://github.com/yiliansource/brackeys-bot/), by splitting functionality into single-purpose bots while maintaining feature parity with version 3.
